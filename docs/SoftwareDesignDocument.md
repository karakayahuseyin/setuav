## Introduction

### Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive overview of the Setuav software system, including its architecture, components, interfaces, and design. This document serves as a reference for developers, designers, and stakeholders involved in the development and maintenance of the Setuav software.

### Scope
The Setuav software system is designed to facilitate the design, performance analysis, and simulation integration processes for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The system provides a set of tools and libraries that enable users to model, analyze, and simulate UAV systems in a user-friendly environment.

The software specifically focuses on:
- Aerodynamic design and analysis of UAV platforms
- Component selection and performance optimization
- Integration with external simulation environments
- Data visualization and reporting capabilities

The system does not include:
- Flight control system implementation
- Real-time flight operations
- Certification or regulatory compliance validation

The software is intended for use by engineers, researchers, and hobbyist in the field of UAV design and simulation. Not intended for commercial use. No liability is taken for any damage caused by the use of this software.

The system is designed to be extensible and modular, allowing users to customize and extend its functionality to meet their specific needs. It is developed entirely as open source and by volunteers. The source code is available on GitHub and can be freely modified and distributed under the terms of the MIT License.

### Target Audience
This document is intended for:
- Software developers contributing to the Setuav project
- UAV design engineers who will use the system
- Academic researchers in aerospace and robotics
- Open-source contributors interested in UAV software

### Definitions and Acronyms
- UAV: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
- API: Application Programming Interface
- GUI: Graphical User Interface
- SDD: Software Design Document
